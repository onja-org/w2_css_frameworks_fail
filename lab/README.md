## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone/download** this lab directory (if you haven't already)
2. **Open terminal** in this lab directory (`/lab`)
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start with Section 1 (Vanilla CSS):**
   - Open `01-vanilla-css/broken-styles.css` in your code editor (The instructions are in this file)
5. **Continue to Section 2 (Tailwind CSS):**
   - Follow the setup instructions in `02-tailwind/SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Once you have Tailwind configured, open `02-tailwind/index.html` in your editor -- you will find instructions here. 
6. **Finish with Section 3 (SASS):**
   - Open `03-sass/scss/styles.scss` in your code editor, where you will find instructions.

## Working Through Each Section

### Recommended Approach
1. **Read the section README** thoroughly before starting
2. **Follow setup instructions** carefully (especially for Tailwind)
3. **Fix diagnostic issues first** - these are specific problems to solve
4. **Run tests frequently** to check your progress:
   ```bash
   npm run test:vanilla    # Test vanilla CSS fixes
   npm run test:tailwind   # Test Tailwind fixes  
   npm run test:sass       # Test SASS fixes
   ```
5. **Work on qualitative improvements** after diagnostic issues are fixed

### Getting Help
- **Read error messages from `npm run test` carefully** - they often contain the solution
- **Check the diagnostic comments** in each file - they provide hints
- **Use the browser developer tools** to inspect elements and styles
- **Ask questions** if you get stuck - learning happens through problem-solving!

## Testing Your Work

Each section includes automated tests to check your diagnostic fixes:

```bash
# Test individual sections
npm run test:vanilla
npm run test:tailwind  
npm run test:sass

# Test everything at once
npm run test:all
```

**Understanding Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ **Green checkmarks** = Issue fixed correctly
- ‚ùå **Red X marks** = Issue still needs fixing
- üí° **Hints provided** for failing tests
