# CSS Frameworks Debugging Lab

**Time Estimate:** 3.5-4 hours  
**Concepts:** CSS Fundamentals, Tailwind CSS, SASS/SCSS  
**Focus:** Debugging, Integration, Best Practices

## Overview

Welcome to the CSS Frameworks Debugging Lab! This lab reinforces fundamental CSS concepts and framework-specific best practices through hands-on debugging challenges.

You'll work through three distinct sections, each representing a different approach to styling web projects:

1. **Vanilla CSS** (60-80 min) - Community Garden theme
2. **Tailwind CSS** (60-80 min) - Clock Repair Shop theme  
3. **SASS/SCSS** (60-80 min) - Yellow Submarine theme

Each section contains both **diagnostic fixes** (specific broken code to debug) and **qualitative improvements** (creative enhancements to make the sites better).
